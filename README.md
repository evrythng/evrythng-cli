# evrythng-cli

> Requires Node.js version 7.6 or greater

Command Line Interface (CLI) for working with the 
[EVRYTHNG API](https://developers.evrythng.com) from a terminal or scripts with 
ease.


## Installation

Install the `npm` module globally as a command:

```
$ npm i -g evrythng-cli
```

Then add at least one Operator using an Operator API Key available
from the 'Account Settings' page of the 
[EVRYTHNG Dashboard](https://dashboard.evrythng.com):

```
$ evrythng operators add $name $region $apiKey
```

For example:

> Key truncated for brevity.

```
$ evrythng operators add prod us AGiWrH5OteA4aHiM...
```


## Usage and Help

After installation, the global `npm` module can be used directly. In general, 
the argument structure is:

```
$ evrythng <command> <params>... [<payload>] [<switches>...]
```

Run `evrythng` to see all commands, switches, and options. 


## Authentication

Authentication is provided in two ways.

1. Using the `operators` command to store Operator API Keys associated with 
   different accounts and regions in the user's `~/.evrythng-cli-config` file. 
   Any request that can be done as an Operator is done with the currently 
   selected Operator.

2. Using the `--api-key` switch to either override the current operator, or 
   provide a separately required key (such as the Application API Key when 
   creating Application Users).

> You must add at least one Operator before you can begin using the CLI.


## Plugins

The EVRYTHNG CLI allows plugins to be created and installed in order to 
add/extend custom functionality as the user requires. These plugins are provided 
with an `api` parameter that contains methods and data they can use to implement 
additional functionality, such as adding new commands.

See the 
[_Plugins_](https://developers.evrythng.com/v3.0/docs/evrythng-cli-plugins#section-published-examples)
page of the documentation for some example plugin implementations.


### Plugin Requirements

In order to be considered a plugin, its `npm` module must meet the following:

* Be installed in the same directory as the CLI, as will be the case when 
  installed globally with `-g` or as a project dependency (i.e: in 
  `node_modules`).
* Have a package name beginning the prefix `evrythng-cli-plugin-`.
* Have a single source file identifyable when it is `require`d, such as setting
  `main` in its `package.json`.
* That file must export a single function, which is provided the `api` parameter
  (see below). Asynchronous functions are not currently supported.

An example of such a plugin is shown below. The basic directory structure is:

```
- evrythng-cli-plugin-greeter
  - package.json (with main: index.js)
  - index.js
```

`index.js` exports a single function that will be run when it is loaded:

```js
module.exports = (api) => {
  const newCommand = {
    about: 'Greet someone',
    firstArg: 'greet',
    operations: {
      greetSomeoneByName: {
        execute: ([name]) => console.log(`Hello there, ${name}!`),
        pattern: '$name',
      },
    },
  };

  // Register a new command
  api.registerCommand(newCommand);
};
```

In the example above, a new command `greet` is added with one operation that 
is provided the remaining arguments, in the same way as regular built-in 
commands. This is validated against a schema before being loaded - it must match 
the structure of the above example.

The example command added in the example is then available as usual when using 
the CLI:

```
$ evrythng greet Charles
Hello there, Charles!
```


### Plugin API

The `api` parameter provided to a plugin's exported function contains the 
following usable methods and data:

* `registerCommand()` - Register a new command.
* `getOptions()` - Retrieve an object describing the user's `options` from the 
  CLI configuration file, which defines the persistent `options` preferences.
* `getSwitches()` - Retrieve an object describing the currently active switches.
* `getConfig()` - Get a `get()`/`set()` interface to the config file.
* `runCommand()` - Run a CLI command using a list of string arguments, such as 
  `['thngs', 'list']`.


## Architecture

### Launch Parameters

The structure of launch parameters is as follows:

```
$ evrythng <command> <params>... [<payload>] [<switches>...]
```

A command is implemented by adding to `commands.js`, and must have the following 
exported structure:

```js
{
  about,
  firstArg,
  operations,
}
```

For example: 

```js
module.exports = {
  about: 'View rate limit information',
  firstArg: 'rate-limits',
  operations: {
    read: {
      execute: async () => http.get('/rateLimits'),
      pattern: 'read',
    },
  },
};
```

This is so that a command can safely implements its functionality using 
parameters that were provided to it. A command is selected when all arguments 
match the `pattern` provided by any given `operations` item, including keywords
such as `$id` or `$type`.

If no command is matched, the help text is displayed. If a command is not fully 
matched, but the arguments do start with a module's `firstArg`, the syntax
for the module's `operations` is printed to help guide the user.

So for example, the `thngs $id read` command:

```
$ evrythng thngs UnghCKffVg8a9KwRwE5C9qBs read
``` 
would receive all tokens after its own name as `args` when the operation is 
called (i.e: all arguments matched its `pattern`):

```
['UnghCKffVg8a9KwRwE5C9qBs', 'read']
```

and is implemented thus:

```js
module.exports = {
  about: 'Work with Thng resources.',
  firstArg: 'thngs',
  operations: {
    readThng: {
      execute: async ([id]) => http.get(`/thngs/${id}`),
      pattern: '$id read',
    },
  },
};
```

This architecture allows easy extension for subcommands of existing commands,
or as entirely new commands that are all agnostic to each other.


### Requests

HTTP requests are performed using the `post`, `get`, `put`, and `delete` methods
exported by `src/modules/http.js`. 

Switches that affect pre- and post-request behavior (such as printing extra 
logs, applying query params, or formatting the API response) are handled 
transparently in this module, so the commands do not have to handle them 
themselves.


### Use of Swagger

The EVRYTHNG CLI uses the 
[`evrythng-swagger` `npm` module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/evrythng-swagger) 
to allow interactive building of `POST` request payloads using the `definitions` 
provided by the EVRYTHNG `swagger.json` API description. This is invoked with 
the `--build` switch:

```
$ evrythng thngs create --build
```

The CLI then asks for each field in the `definition` (that is not marked as 
`readOnly`) specified in the command that implements `payloadBuilder.build()`, 
in this case `ThngDocument`:

```js
createThng: {
  execute: async ([, json]) => {
    const payload = await util.buildPayload('ThngDocument', json);
    return http.post('/thngs', payload);
  },
  pattern: 'create $payload',
},
```

The user is then asked to input their values, including sub-objects such as 
`customFields`:

```
$ evrythng thngs create --build

Provide values for each field (or leave blank to skip):

1/7: name (string): My New Thng
2/7: tags (comma-separated list of string): cli,generated,objects
3/7: description (string): This Thng was created interactively
4/7: customFields (object, leave 'key' blank to finish)
  key: origin
  value: evrythng-cli
  key:
5/7: identifiers (object, leave 'key' blank to finish)
  key: serial
  value: 432897
  key:
6/7: product (string):
7/7: collections (comma-separated list of string):

{
  "id": "U5AgdeSQBg8aQKawwHsxkbcs",
  "createdAt": 1530278943537,
  "customFields": {
    "origin": "evrythng-cli"
  },
  "tags": [
    "cli",
    "generated",
    "objects"
  ],
  "updatedAt": 1530278943537,
  "name": "My New Thng",
  "description": "This Thng was created interactively",
  "identifiers": {
    "serial": "432897"
  }
}
```


### Switches

Any launch parameter that begins with `--` is treated as a switch, and is 
extracted from the launch parameters by `switches.js` in the `extract()` method
before the remaining `args` are provided to the matched command.

After `extract()` is called, a switch's state in any given invocation can be 
determined as shown below for an example command:

```
$ evrythng thngs list --with-scopes
```

```js
const switches = require('../modules/switches');

if (switches.SCOPES) {
  // --with-scopes was specified
}
```

If a switch is configured in `SWITCH_LIST` to be given with a value 
(`hasValue`), it is made available as `value`. This is specified at invocation 
time as follows:

```
$ evrythng thngs list --filter tags=test
```

The value would be read in code as:

```js
const filter = switches.FILTER;

if (filter) {
  console.log(`Filter value was ${filter}`);
}
```

```
Filter value was tags=test
```


## Development

### Running Tests

Run `npm test` to run the Mocha tests in the `tests` directory. Ensure `use` an 
appropriate Operator first!

Afterwards, see `reports/index.html` for code coverage results.
